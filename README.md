# Electron-Distribution
A program that shows the user the name, the letter and the electron distribution of an atom just by typing its atomic number.

Example:

User Entry> 8

K layer: 2
L layer: 6
M layer: 0
N layer: 0
O layer: 0
P layer: 0
Q layer: 0

Name: Oxygen | Letter: O | Atomic Number: 8

It is important to don't delete any file from the program, because it wouldn't work as it had to.

IF YOU DON'T HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED, JUST OPEN THE EXECUTABLE FILE INSIDE THE 'DIST' FOLDER
